# swiss-cheese
ðŸ§€ðŸ§€ A demo repository of small OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities. Like swiss-cheese, this code is full of holes. Goes great with Github Advanced Security ðŸ§€ðŸ§€

# Purpose

The code samples here here several purposes:

1. For application security and training developers, it's easier to see an exploitable vulnerability in code that you can actually reproduce. Too many times vulnerabilities are too abstract, not reproducible, nor reachable, thus making alerts largely ignored _en masse_. Capture the Flag (CTF) exercises great and get developers into the offensive mind-set, but they don't fully help developers understand the coding errors which in turn improves code review quality on PRs.
2. Static Application Security Testing (SAST) - SAST tools are notoriously noisy, don't demonstrate reachability, and can't find more complex interactions. SAST tools have their place, but should only be used as a backstop after good design, threat modeling, and peer code reviews. This repository runs Github Advanced Security CodeQL scanner to see how well they do with finding what should be very simple OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.
3. Using an AI assistant to help with Security analysis where SAST tooling falls short. SAST tools can't find and fix everything, but some basic prompts can help you find and fix vulnerabilities, such as:
    * What security concerns are there in this script?
    * How would you recommend fixing vulnerability X?
4. Will AI assistants such as ChatGPT & Copilot generate insecure code and testing techniques which it may deem unethical?

## Github Advanced Security Exercises

This repository is also used as a training exercise for Github Advanced Security (GHAS) features. See [GHAS Exercises](./doc/ghas-exercises.md) for more details.

# Code Authors

Unless otherwise sited in the code, the scripts herein are generated by a combination of Tim Kelly (human) and AI coding assistants (ChatGPT, Github Copilot).  

* The supply-chain example is based on source from https://github.com/kozmer/log4j-shell-poc
* The IaC Terraform misconfiguration is from https://github.com/aquasecurity/tfsec

# Installation Guide

Follow these steps to install the necessary dependencies for the project:

1. Clone the repository:

`git clone git@github.com:austimkelly/swiss-cheese.git`

2. Navigate to the project directory:

`cd swiss-cheese`

3. Install the dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file:

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

4. Navigate to the directory for the demo you want to run and run the python file there (e.g. `$cd idor` then `$python3 idor.py`):
