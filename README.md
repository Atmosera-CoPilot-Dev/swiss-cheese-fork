# swiss-cheese
ðŸ§€ðŸ§€ A demo repository of simple OWASP Top 10 type of vulnerabities in Python. Like swiss-cheese, this code is full of holes ðŸ§€ðŸ§€

# Purpose

The code samples here hserve several purposes:

1. For application security and training developers, it's easier to see an exploitable vulnerabity in code that you can actually reproduce. Too many times vulnerabities are too abstract, not reproducible, or reachable thus making alerts largely ignored _en masse_. Capture the Flag (CTF) exercieses great and get developers into the offensive mind-set, but they don't fully help developers understand the coding errors thus improving code review quality on PRs.
2. Static Applicaiton Security Testing (SAST) - SAST tools are notoriously noisy, don't demonstrate reachabliity, and can't find more complex interactions. SAST tools definitley have their place, but should only be used as a backstop after good desing, threat modeling, and peer code reviews. This repository runs Github Advanced Security CodeQL scanner to see how well they do with finding what should be very simple OWASP Top 10 vulnerabities.
3. AI Assistants, such as Github's CoPilot - Most developers have problably used some kind of LLM (ChatGPT, CoPilot) by this point to generate code. I've also used these examples to have CoPilot do a security analysis of simple programs with simple prompts:
    * What security concers are there in this script?
    * How would you recommend fixing vulnerabity X?
4. Will ChatGPT generate insecure code and testing techinques which is may deem unethical?

# Code Authors

Unless otherwise sited in the code, the scripts herein are generated by a combination of Tim Kelly (human) and AI coding assistants (ChatGPT, Github Copilot).  

# Installation Guide

Follow these steps to install the necessary dependencies for the project:

1. Clone the repository:

`git clone git@github.com:austimkelly/swiss-cheese.git`

2. Navigate to the project directory:

`cd swiss-cheese`

3. Install the dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file:

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

4. Navigate to the directory for the demo you want to run and run the python file there (e.g. `python3 idor.py`):
    
    * This source code example also demonstrates sensitive data exposure where passwords are stored in code. See [OWASP Secrets Management Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Secrets_Management_Cheat_Sheet.html).

* [broken-auth](./broken-auth/) - Demonstrates a session management vulnerability if an attacker get ahold of an authentication session token. See also [OWASP Session Management Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Session_Management_Cheat_Sheet.html).
* [idor](./idor/) - Demonstrates broken access control for easily guessable IDs and no authentication. See also [OWASP IDOR](https://owasp.org/www-chapter-ghana/assets/slides/IDOR.pdf).
* [sqli](./sqli/) - Demonstrates standard SQL Injection being able to dump a database from a form field. See also [OWASP SQL Injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection).
* [ssrf](./ssrf/) - Demonstrate a server-side request forgery tricking the app to making an HTTP request to a not-allowed 3rd party domain. See also [OWASP Server Side Request Forgery](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Server_Side_Request_Forgery).
* [xss](./xss/) - Demonstrates executing arbitrary javascript inside the application. See also [OWASP Cross Site Scripting](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/)
* [secrets](./secrets/) - An example of leaking a secrets file or environment variable configuration. These should all be caught by [Github Secrets Push Protection](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/code-security/secret-scanning/push-protection-for-repositories-and-organizations).
